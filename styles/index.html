      About Kat
      Kat is the ultimate cat lady you've always dreamed you could
      be. Never has a Halloween gone by where her twelve cats weren't
      all dressed to impress. Five years ago, she decided to open
      Kat's Costume Shop to share her passion with the world.

      About Mavis
      Mavis has been designing custom clothes for her three
      cats since she was fifteen years old. She loves working on
      custom orders. Her cats are often roaming freely throughout
      the store and modeling the latest trends.
